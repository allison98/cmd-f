  <p>
    cmd-f my voice. is a tool to help you easily find keywords in recordings.
    Students can upload recorded lectures, study sessions, or any audio files of their choice. 
    When you enter a keyword, timestamps of each occurence of the word in the audio is
    listed so that you can quickly jump to that moment in the file.  </p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p> This tool was made with student convenience in mind. Parse through up to an hour of lecture within seconds, saving more time for actual studying!! 
        Organize your notes, pinpoint areas of confusion, or jump quickly to relevant or key ideas. </p>
        
  <h3>How?</h3>
  <p>
    cmd-f my voice. uses Google Cloud Storage API to store the user-uploaded file and the 
    Google Speech-to-Text API to transcribe audio files into text and extract the timestamps of 
    all occurrences of the keyword.  </p>
